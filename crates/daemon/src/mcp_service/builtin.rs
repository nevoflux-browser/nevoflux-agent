//! Built-in browser and computer tools, executed by the daemon itself.
//!
//! # Why the catalogue is filtered
//!
//! [`nevoflux_mcp::create_tools`] is the published catalogue (name, description,
//! JSON schema). The thing that actually runs a tool is
//! [`crate::wasm::mcp_tool_executor::execute_mcp_tool`], whose dispatch table
//! grew separately and does not cover the catalogue one-for-one: a few computer
//! tools are spelled differently there, and a few have no implementation at all.
//! [`BuiltinSource::tools`] therefore advertises only what
//! [`BuiltinSource::call`] can dispatch — an MCP client that lists a tool can
//! always call it. Names that drop out are logged rather than silently
//! vanishing.
