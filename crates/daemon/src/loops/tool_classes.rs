//! Iteration-specific tool guards.
//!
//! Historical note: this module used to maintain a parallel "tool class"
//! taxonomy (Read / Write / DomClick / Nav / etc.) for /loop iterations.
//! That taxonomy used fictitious tool names that didn't match the real
//! `builtin-wasm::Agent::get_chat_tools()` catalog, so iterations ended
//! up with empty allowlists (no `browser_query` etc.).
//!
//! Migration 018 replaced the class system with the existing
//! `AgentMode { Chat, Browser, Agent }` enum from `builtin-wasm`, and
//! the iteration's tool catalog now comes directly from
//! `Agent::get_tools_for_mode(mode)`. The only iteration-specific filter
//! left is [`is_forbidden_in_iteration`].

/// Single source of truth for the iteration-forbidden tool names.
/// `loop_create` would let an iteration spawn nested loops; `ask_user` blocks
/// on a sidebar that may be closed. `goal_set` would let an unattended
/// iteration hijack the interactive session's active goal (goals are
/// session-scoped, single-active), and `schedule_create` would let an
/// iteration self-replicate scheduled jobs — both are catalog-filtered out
/// of direct-API unattended runs here (see `agent_exec::filter_allowlist`).
/// `loop_evolve` and `loop_proposal_respond` are the self-improvement
/// (evolve) feature's propose/accept operations; letting an unattended
/// iteration call both in the same turn would let it approve its own
/// rewrite with zero human review, defeating the whole point of the
/// evolve accept/reject gate.
