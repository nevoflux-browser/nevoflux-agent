//! The control channel: one session list, kept current (design §5, §13).
//!
//! The second of the two channels a paired device holds. Where the data channel
//! replays one conversation and needs a sequencer behind `resume{from}`, this
//! one sends **idempotent snapshots**: the whole list, whenever it changes, and
//! again in full whenever somebody attaches. There is nothing to resume,
//! because an old snapshot is never worth delivering.
//!
//! Two things it deliberately does not do:
//!
//! - **It does not read the chat stream.** `project` ignores
//!   [`OutboundEvent::Chat`] entirely. The runtime map is computed once for the
//!   daemon, at the tap, by [`super::runtime_state::RuntimeTracker`]; this is a
//!   projection of that map, one per paired device. Handling chat here as well
//!   would put N copies of one computation back on the hot path — and that path
//!   sits in front of local sidebar delivery.
//! - **It does not send from `project`.** Sending happens on its own task, off
//!   a `watch` subscription. `Running` is signalled once per delta, so a single
//!   reply is hundreds of state signals; a snapshot per signal would put a
//!   whole turn's worth of identical frames on a phone's radio. `watch` keeps
//!   only the latest value and wakes on genuine change, which is the same
//!   semantics the snapshot model already wanted.
