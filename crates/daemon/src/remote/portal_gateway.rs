//! The portal `RemoteGateway` impl (design §9, gateway #1).
//!
//! Wraps a [`PortalSession`] behind a mutex + an injectable [`WireSink`], so the
//! projection logic (translate → seq-tag → encode) is unit-tested here and the
//! concrete tokio-tungstenite send lands later as a `WireSink` impl. The read
//! loop drives [`resume`](PortalGateway::resume) and uplink injection off
//! [`PortalSession::route`].
