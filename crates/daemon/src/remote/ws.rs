//! tokio-tungstenite transport for the portal gateway (design §2.D). Dials the
//! relay, feeds the read stream into [`PortalGateway::on_wire_in`], and writes
//! outbound frames through a swappable [`WsSink`] so the gateway (and its Y2
//! `SendSequencer`) survives reconnects — only the socket write half is
//! replaced. The gateway is created once and registered in the daemon's
//! `GatewayRegistry` (via `register`), so the M2 tap's `fan_out` keeps reaching
//! it across reconnects.
//!
//! Runtime is verified against a deployed relay (the sans-IO gateway core,
//! injection, and `Wire`↔`Message` conversion are unit-tested; the connect /
//! reconnect loop is integration-only).
